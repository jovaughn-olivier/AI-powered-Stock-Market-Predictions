# Stock Market Predictions

## Overview

In this comprehensive project, I delve into a basic stock market analysis, leveraging a dataset spanning 20+ years to extract valuable insights into the stock market.

As part of my analysis, I explore monthly trends to discern recurring patterns over the decades and investigate the relationship between volatility, VOLQ (Nasdaq Volatility Index), and market downturns. My study also includes a detailed examination of daily volume and percent return correlations for the key market indices, SPY, QQQ, and DIA, aiming to uncover any detectable? patterns or trends. Additionally, a daily average return function is employed to provide a nuanced understanding of daily market dynamics.

This undertaking was inspired by my passion for the markets, and its primary objective is to unravel/reveal patterns, anomalies, and correlations within the extensive stock market data to address pivotal questions related to market behavior.

Throughout this project, I utilized various tools, including Python, Pandas, and other relevant libraries, ensuring transparency and reproducibility in the analytical process. The following sections will expand upon the data selection, methodology, results, and discussions, providing a comprehensive view of the multifaceted analysis conducted on the stock market's historical data.

## Data Selection

The data processing and modeling were conducted using a Jupyter Notebook and are available [here](https://github.com/jovaughn-olivier/Stocks_and_Data-Science/blob/main/Code/Workspace.ipynb).

The data used to analyze volume's correlation with stock price contained 5300â€“6800 samples with 7 features: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close, and Volume.

The dataset can be found online on Kaggle [[1]](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jacksoncrow/stock-market-dataset), where you will also find the script used to collect said data [[2]](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jacksoncrow/download-nasdaq-historical-data/notebook).

## Methods
Tools:

Data Analysis and Inference: NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn
Deployment and Version Control: GitHub
IDE: Jupyter Notebook
Inference methods used with Scikit:
-  linear regression model
For my analysis, I utilized the linear regression model provided by Scikit-learn within the Jupyter Notebook environment. Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. We opted for this method due to its simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness in capturing linear relationships within the data. However, it's important to note that linear regression assumes a linear association between variables, and deviations from linearity could impact its accuracy.
