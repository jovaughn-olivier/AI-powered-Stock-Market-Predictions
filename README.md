## Stock Market Predictions

### Overview

In this comprehensive project, I delve into a basic analysis of the stock market, leveraging a dataset spanning 20+ years to extract valuable insights into monthly trends, market sentiment, and the interplay between volume and percent returns on key market indices like SPY, QQQ, and DIA. 

The primary objective of this undertaking is to unravel patterns, anomalies, and correlations within the extensive stock market data, addressing pivotal questions related to market behavior and volatility.

As part of the analysis, I explore monthly trends to discern recurring patterns over the decades and investigate the intriguing relationship between the VIX (Volatility Index) and market downturns. The study also includes a detailed examination of weekly volume and percent return correlations for SPY, QQQ, and DIA, aiming to uncover any discernible patterns or trends. Additionally, a daily average return function is employed to provide a nuanced understanding of daily market dynamics. 

Throughout this project, I utilize a variety of tools, including Python, pandas, and other relevant libraries, ensuring transparency and reproducibility in the analytical process. The ensuing sections will expound upon the data selection, methodology, results, and discussions, providing a comprehensive view of the multifaceted analysis conducted on the stock market's historical data.

### Data Selection

The data processing and modeling were conducted using a Jupyter Notebook and are available [here](https://github.com/jovaughn-olivier/Stocks_and_Data-Science/blob/main/Code/Workspace.ipynb).

The data used to analyze volume's correlation with stock price can be found [here], and the files used contained 5300 - 6800 samples with 7 features: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adjusted Close, and Volume.

*The objective is to predict hospital charges. The dataset can found online at git[4]. Many example solutions and analysis can be found at kaggle [5]

### Methods
Tools:

Data Analysis and Inference: NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn
Deployment and Version Control: GitHub
IDE: Jupyter Notebook
Inference methods used with Scikit:
-  linear regression model
For our analysis, we utilized the linear regression model provided by Scikit-learn within the Jupyter Notebook environment. Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. We opted for this method due to its simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness in capturing linear relationships within the data. However, it's important to note that linear regression assumes a linear association between variables, and deviations from linearity could impact its accuracy.
